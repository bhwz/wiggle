# Wiggle

## Python tools for coding WAV formatted PCM streams into various web and app friendly formats.

Wiggle is a library and toolkit that wraps well-known audio encoding libraries
such as libopus and fdk-aac with the intent to provide an easy way to transform
audio masters into formats easily consumed by modern browsers and apps.

Please note that due to patent restrictions, Wiggle does not directly include any
encoder implementations. You must supply the binaries for them yourself. The license
for Wiggle only covers the Python bindings and tools published in this repository.
